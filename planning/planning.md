high risk for ticks in Southern Jalisco coast. Allow user to search their 
address. Also include lists of recommendations to combat ticks.

2. Flesh out site with recommendations for treating ticks and more written 
details on where high risk zones
3. Once available, import Diego's model into Google Maps API-friendly format
4. Use data to add visualization layer to the Map
5. Ensure mobile-friendliness and adequate speed
6. If time and information, change data depending on season
7. If time, allow user to click on zones to get the information about zone
8. If time, incorporate geolocation to show where user is
